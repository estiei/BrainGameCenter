    <h1>Results of the verbal part of the Shipley test</h1>

    <p>
    The data is generated automatically for 120 participants: 60 participants represent a group with average performance, 30 participants perform above average, and 30 perform below average.
    The data is distributed quasi-normally on two dimensions: response time and correctness.
    For representing the results, we use Item Response Theory (IRT) to evaluate two parameters: the ability of each participant to answer test questions and the difficulty of each test item.
    More about IRT can be found here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory">Item Response Theory</a>.

    <p>
    We start with the general representation of test results for the tested group.
    The graph below shows the overall distribution of the number of correct answers among the participants.
    Number of questions = 40.

    <p>
    The graph below shows the ability (agency) of the participants to answer the test questions.
    Ability is calculated using Item Response Theory (IRT), which measures an individual's proficiency or skill level in the domain being tested.
    Ability is typically represented on a continuous scale, with a mean of 0.
    This scale is arbitrary but helps in interpreting the relative proficiency of individuals within the tested group.

    <p>
    The standard deviation (SD) indicates the variability in the abilities of participants who were able to answer a certain number of questions correctly.

    <div class="graph">

        {% autoescape off %}

        {{ correct_answers_vs_ability }}

        {% endautoescape %}

    <p>
    On the graph below, you can see the questions (words) ranked according to the time spent on each question and the average percentage of correct answers.
    To change the representation, please select the desired scale from the drop-down menu.

    <p>
    The following graph shows the correlation between item difficulty and the amount of time spent on each item.
    In IRT, difficulty is a parameter that indicates how challenging a test item is, defined by the ability level at which there is a 50% chance of a correct response.
